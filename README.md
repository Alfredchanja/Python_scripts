# Python Crush Course, A Hands-on, Project-Based Introduction to Programming

>"Do not despise these small beginnings, for the Lord rejoices to see this work begin, to see the plumb line in Zerubbabel's hands." - Zechariah 4:10

In this project you will see me grow from a beginner programmer to a more advance one. I am not very conversant with coding, however, I have always wanted to learn how to code. I always liked it when I watched in movies how people solve problems by simply using a computer. So I decided to go out on a limp and learn on my own. Is it possible to be a self taught programmer? I do not know, how about we find that out together.

For this project I will be using the book *"Python Crush Course, A Hands-on, Project-Based Introduction to Programming"* by *Eric Matthes*.
